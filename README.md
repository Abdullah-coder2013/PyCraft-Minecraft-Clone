This is a simple Minecraft Clone based on ClearCode's simple minecraft clone.
All the textures you see, every pixel you see, is made by me in Pixilart.

There are 12 different kinds of blocks *Not like ClearCode*:
1 = GrassBlock
2 = StoneBlock
3 = DirtBlock
4 = BrickBlock
5 = SandBlock
6 = Obsidian
7 = SnowBlock
8 = GravelBlock
9 = WoodLog
0 = WoodPlanks
k = Water/LapisBlock
l = Lava

There is also some mods *Not like ClearCode*:

t = Table
y = Sofa/WoolChair

You can build a Monastry with these blocks! *Not like ClearCode*

Also a big Mansion! *Not like ClearCode*

If you have any questions, feel free to report an issue on the GitHub repository either it is a bug or a question.

Have fun Coding!
Happy Minecrafting!
